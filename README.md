### Hi there üëã

I am Thai, a full-stack engineer at Livewire Market. I have over 7 years of experience in Ruby on Rails. I have experience with data and web caching, having improved the performance of a background system that handles thousands of stock market announcements daily by queue and elasticsearch. Unfortunately, my career at Livewire Market ended in February 2024 due to the global economic impact.

I am working part-time for Motionscloud and looking for a stable job. Some stacks I can do well:
- Ruby/Ruby on Rails
- Python/Django
- C# .Net
- NodeJS (Fastify)
- CI/CD & DevOps (CircleCI and Github actions)
- Elasticsearch, Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Automation E2E tests.
- Micro front-end
- TailwindCSS, VueJS, ReacJS
- Data, web caching
- RabbitMQ, BullMQ, Sidekiq
- Twilio & AWS-Chime video streaming
- WebSocket
- Global Positioning System (GPS)

Thanks for reading my readme üôè
